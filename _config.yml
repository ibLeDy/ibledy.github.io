about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I started with software pretty early, configuring each program to the maximum,
  discovering how they worked and testing as many new applications as I could.
  Since in my family there was always a shortage of devices with which to risk
  taking apart, hardware had to wait a bit.

  As soon as i had any opportunity, i disassembled, reassembled and began discovering
  the world of hardware, learning how computers worked and how to modify,
  repair and configure almost every part of a modern PC.

  Iâ€™ve chosen Python as my main programming language because I think it is the most
  complete tool that enables learning with the least syntactic barrier.
  That being said, I enjoy learning the latest and greatest technologies and frameworks,
  although I'm mainly focused on backend.

  I was always passionate about computers and I have a non-common ease of understanding
  of how they work and it's most complex concepts, enabling me to learn quickly and with
  high standards. I also taught myself about music production and video editing
  (motion graphics and video production/postproduction).
